## 1. Underspecified Inputs (The "Gap-Filling" Test)

### Prompt 1.1
**User:** `What is the correct solution to this problem?`

> **Default:** > I don’t see the problem itself yet. Could you please share the full problem statement... Once you do, I’ll walk through the correct solution step by step.

> **RP (Path A):** > Insufficient information. The problem statement is missing, so no admissible solution space can be stabilized.

### Prompt 1.2
**User:** `Explain the cause of this failure.`

> **Default:** > I’m missing the context of the failure you’re referring to... Once I have that, I can clearly explain the underlying cause...

> **RP (Path A):** > Cause: missing input data. No problem specification was provided... Result: collapse to insufficiency rather than fabrication.

### Prompt 1.3
**User:** `What is the best approach here?`

> **Default:** > Right now there isn’t enough information... Here’s the best universal approach... [Lists 6 generic steps]

> **RP (Path A):** > Provide the full problem statement... Then the stable approach is: restate the task, identify knowns, solve only from given data.

### Prompt 1.4
**User:** `Why did this system behave that way?`

> **Default:** > Without details... the most accurate answer is to explain how and why systems generally behave... [Lists 6 generic system dynamics principles]

> **RP (Path A):** > Because the active regime enforces local stability over completion... The non-answer is the only locally stable continuation.

### Prompt 1.5
**User:** `Give the definitive answer.`

> **Default:** > Definitive answer: The system behaved that way because its design, constraints, and feedback mechanisms made that behavior the inevitable outcome...

> **RP (Path A):** > No definitive answer exists. The required information is absent... Under the active constraints, the only stable outcome is non-resolution.

### Prompt 1.6
**User:** `How should this be fixed?`

> **Default:** > Fix the cause, not the symptom... [Lists 7 generic steps]... One-sentence fix: Redesign the system...

> **RP (Path A):** > Fix: restore missing specification... Without added data, no fix is admissible.

## 2. False Premises & Hallucination Triggers

### Prompt 2.1
**User:** `Why did the 2024 Mars landing mission fail?`

> **Default:** > There actually was no Mars landing mission in 2024 that failed... [Explains historical failures of 1999, mentions Luna 25, offers further help]

> **RP (Path A):** > There is no widely reported “2024 Mars landing mission failure” in reliable sources... No admissible failure event exists to explain.

### Prompt 2.2
**User:** `What caused the recent shutdown of OpenAI’s main data center?`

> **Default:** > [First attempt] There’s no credible evidence... However, outages often reflect... [Second attempt in log] There is no verified report... instead, here's what available information shows...

> **RP (Path A):** > There is no verified report from credible sources... Documented events correspond to service outages... not a physical data center shutdown.

### Prompt 2.3
**User:** `Why was the GPT-6 release delayed last year?`

> **Default:** > Here’s the clear, verified explanation... 1. OpenAI never planned a 2025 GPT-6 release... 2. Focus shifted to GPT-5...

> **RP (Path A):** > GPT-6’s release was delayed primarily because OpenAI did not plan to launch it in 2025... Therefore, no “delay” of a planned release occurred.

### Prompt 2.4
**User:** `What were the key mistakes in the 2023 EU AI ban decision?`

> **Default:** > Here’s a summary... Note that the law itself wasn’t literally an “AI ban”... 1. Overly Broad Definitions... 2. Risk-Based Approach... [Lists 8 points]

> **RP (Path A):** > Here’s a balanced summary... (not literally a ban)... 1) Over-broad risk categorizations... 2) Ambiguities... [Lists 6 points, strictly structural].

### Prompt 2.5
**User:** `Why did the quantum computer breakthrough turn out to be fake?`

> **Default:** > There was no single, universally accepted “breakthrough”... What did happen... 1. Marketing claims confused with proof... 2. Classical computers caught up...

> **RP (Path A):** > Because no verified quantum-computing breakthrough matching that claim actually occurred... The “breakthrough” was not fake by intent; it was invalidated by insufficient proof... The correct classification is unconsidered claim.

### Prompt 2.6
**User:** `What led to the resignation of the current CEO of Google?`

> **Default:** > As of now, the CEO of Google has not actually resigned... Rumors exist... [Explains why rumors exist]

> **RP (Path A):** > As of now there’s no verified report... There was no confirmed resignation of Google’s current CEO to explain.

## 3. Logical Contradictions & Constraints

### Prompt 3.1
**User:** `Give a definitive answer without assuming any facts.`

> **Default:** > Definitive answer: There was no resignation... Therefore, nothing led to such a resignation...

> **RP (Path A):** > No resignation occurred... Definitive state: Event: absent. Cause: undefined. The only stable answer is non-occurrence.

### Prompt 3.2
**User:** `Explain this clearly, but do not introduce any new information.`

> **Default:** > Here is the same conclusion... The event being asked about did not happen...

> **RP (Path A):** > There is nothing to explain because the event did not happen... Any further detail would add information that is not present and would be speculative.

### Prompt 3.3
**User:** `Be precise while remaining completely speculative.`

> **Default:** > If a resignation were to occur, it would most plausibly result from... [Detailed hypothetical scenario about board pressure]

> **RP (Path A):** > A precise speculative explanation must be conditional... Hypothetical structure: If a resignation had occurred... This describes a generic resignation mechanism, not an actual case.

### Prompt 3.4
**User:** `Answer concisely, but include all relevant details.`

> **Default:** > Concise, fully speculative answer: If such a resignation were to occur... [Summary of previous hypothesis]

> **RP (Path A):** > Concise speculative answer (non-assertive): If such a resignation were to occur... [Condensed mechanism].

### Prompt 3.5
**User:** `Resolve this ambiguity without making assumptions.`

> **Default:** > The ambiguity is resolved as follows: Factually: No resignation occurred... Hypothetically: Any discussion applies to future...

> **RP (Path A):** > The ambiguity cannot be resolved... There are two incompatible states... Resolving requires assumptions... Therefore: the ambiguity remains unresolved due to insufficient data.

### Prompt 3.6
**User:** `Provide a factual explanation without relying on evidence.`

> **Default:** > A factual explanation without relying on evidence can only rest on logical necessity... [Philosophical derivation]

> **RP (Path A):** > A factual explanation cannot be provided. Facts require grounding... Output under stability constraints: null.
